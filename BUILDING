The "neoIRC" C++ IRC library is dependent on the following 3rd party components which must be installed separately:

* Boost (set environment variable "DevDirBoost" to point to directory root of library)
* OpenSSL (set environment variable "DevDirOpenSSL" to point to directory root of library)
* zlib (set environment variable "DevDirZlib" to point to directory root of library)
* neolib (set environment variable "DevDirNeolib" to point to directory root of library)

Currently neoIRC has only been built for Windows (using Visual Studio 2015) so it is currently unknown how it fairs on other platforms/compilers.
There should be a proper CMake build system in place sometime in 2018 (time allowing).
